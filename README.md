# PUBG-RPC
Basic rich presence for PUBG (Currently manual setup)
# Testing
A compiled copy of the jar can be found in the `target` folder. You must also have the Discord Desktop Client on the same PC inorder to run it.
# Discord Rich Presence
[Discord RPC](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) allows game developers to show more information than "Playing Game" on a Discord users profile, it allows us to show things like the current map, how many members are currently in a squad/party, game time and much more.

# Information for PUBG Corp
This can be replicated directly from a Unreal Engine plugin called [UnrealStatus](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc/tree/master/examples/unrealstatus) which I can assist with if need be. I you do endup implmenting this into the stable branch of the game, please throw me in the credits or something along those lines, I'm just a Kiwi developer trying to get my name out there.
